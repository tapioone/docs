## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/tapioone/docs/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/tapioone/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix!

#### Make Changes

1. Install the correct node version (see `package.json`).
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/tapioone/docs.git`.
3. Install all dependencies `npm install`.
4. Start the development server `npm run start`.
5. Make your changes.

#### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Please adhere to the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for naming your commits.

#### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link your PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, a friendly bot will kindly ask you to sign our [CLA](https://github.com/tapioone/cla).
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
