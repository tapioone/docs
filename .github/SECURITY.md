## Reporting Security Issues

The tapio team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings!

To report a security issue, **DO NOT** open a GitHub issue, but send us an email to [developer@tapio.one](mailto:developer@tapio.one?subject=SECURITY) including the word `SECURITY` in the subject line.

The tapio team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
