# Constraints for Aggregation of Historic Data

To be able to detect the lifetime of a condition (time frame where a condition is active) the are some rules how the conditions should be reported by the OPC UA server:

Within the OPC UA standard there is no identifier to detect a single "reporting" of a condition, so tapio uses the following properties of a condition transferred by the CloudConnector:

- From OPC UA server: SourceTimeStamp (STS)
- From CloudConnector Config: tapio machine id (tmid)
- From CloudConnector Config: provider
- From OC UA server/CC Config: key

The [tapio Data Categories](../../machine-data/tapio-data-categories) describes the transferred [condition data](../../machine-data/tapio-data-categories#condition) in more detail.

These 4 properties combined mark a single `instance` of a reported condition. To be able to identify the correct `lifetime` of such a condition `instance` there are a few constraints:

- SourceTimeStamp (STS) has to be changed when values of the condition are changed, the condition then counts as new condition `instance`
- Other condition data must not change when setting the active state to FALSE (see [condition data](../../machine-data/tapio-data-categories#condition)).
- The `<CyclicUpdateInSec>600</CyclicUpdateInSec>` Property of OPC UA Source Groups in the CloudConnector config should be lower than 10.5 minutes. The suggested value is 600 seconds / 10 minutes.

The historic occurrence of this condition instances can be queried with the historic data api, see also the description of the [Historic Data](../../machine-data/historical-data).

Visual examples how the condition lifetime in the tapio systems are processed:

![Normal condition behavior](../../../static/img/docs/opcua-condition-lifetime-1.png "Normal condition behavior")

The normal dataflow contains a condition active message with several condition refreshes until a condition inactive message is send.

![Condition lifetime with changed properties](../../../static/img/docs/opcua-condition-lifetime-2.png "Condition lifetime with changed properties")

When a condition active/inactive message is received with non matching properties compared to the previous condition, or with a different SourceTimeStamp, the end of this previous condition is set to the received condition timestamp.

![Condition lifetime assumed end](../../../static/img/docs/opcua-condition-lifetime-3.png "Condition lifetime assumed end")

When for condition no updates or refreshes are received the condition will be marked as inactive 10.5 minutes after the last matching message.
