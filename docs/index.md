# tapio Guide

tapio is the digital ecosystem for the woodworking industry. It enables both small carpenters and industrial furniture productions to digitalize their production in a short period of time. It even allows third party developers, to implement new solutions, based on the data of tapio-connected machines.

To understand the concept behind tapio and to develop applications based on our ecosystem, follow the guides listed below.

* If you're a machine manufacturer and you want to integrate you're machine into the tapio system, see our [Manufacturer-Section](./manufacturer/)
* If you're a application developer and you want to develop an app for the tapio ecosystem, see our [General-Section](./general/)
* If you want to integrate our products in your products see our [Product-Section](./products/) and our [General-Section](./general/)
